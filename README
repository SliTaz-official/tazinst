SliTaz Installer
================================================================================


The first SliTaz installer was built using ncurses Dialog within a SHell script. 
It was the last SliTaz home made tool that didn't have a desktop integrated 
interface and had some crappy code as it was written at the start of the 
project.

Tazinst is the new installer written entirely in SHell script and usable from 
the cmdline without dialog or any other gui-like interface! This new installer
is able to perform an installation automatically based on a simple config file
with clear variables such as: INST_TYPE="iso", TGT_PARTITION="/dev/hda1".

With this way, it allows developers to create a different kind of frontend: 
Dialog, GTK and CGI/web in TazPanel. The frontend just has to create a config 
file and start the cmdline installer and report steps in a nice way (progress 
bar or/and messages).


i18n
----
Tazinst has been coded from the beginning with gettext support. Please
forget 'echo' and use gettext, but remember that gettext "" is equivalent
to echo -n. All scripts use the same TEXTDOMAIN and the same pot files, all
translations go in the po/ folder.
 
To start a new translation please use msginit from the pot file directory. 
Example for French/France locale (fr_FR):

$ msginit -l fr_FR -o fr.po -i tazinst.pot

To update all translations from a newly updated pot file:

$ make msgmerge
Or:
$ msgmerge -U fr.po tazinst.pot
