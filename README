SliTaz Installer
================================================================================

Tazinst is the SliTaz installer written entirely in SHell script and usable
from the cmdline without dialog or any other gui-like interface! This installer
is able to perform an installation automatically based on a simple config file
with clear variables such as: INST_TYPE="iso", TGT_PARTITION="/dev/hda1".

With this way, it allows developers to create a different kind of frontend:
Dialog, CGI/web. Two frontends are included: slitaz-installer, a ncurses
frontend, and a CGI/web frontend.


i18n
----
Tazinst has been coded from the beginning with gettext support. Please
forget 'echo' and use gettext, but remember that gettext "" is equivalent
to echo -n. All translations go in the po/ folder.

To start a new translation please use msginit from the pot file directory.
Example for French/France locale (fr_FR):

$ msginit -l fr_FR -o fr.po -i tazinst.pot

To update all translations from a newly updated pot file:

$ make msgmerge
Or:
$ msgmerge -U fr.po tazinst.pot
